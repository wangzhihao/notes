I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my vim plugins.

I use [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for code-completion, currently most use cases is for JavaMy via [jdt.ls](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls). If the YouComepleteMe/jdt.ls doesn't work, `YcmRestartServer` can be a good way to recover it and `YcmDebugInfo` can be used to find the log.
