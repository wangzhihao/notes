# Frequency moments

The [frequency moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm#Frequency_moments) is a generalized form of a series of problems: F0 is the distinct elements count, F1 is the total element count, F2 is the Gini coefficient. Such a generalized form is similar to  [power mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_mean). Acutally they are so similar that frequency moment borrows some concept from power mean and leverage power mean's properties in its own proof.

The idea to view the online learning process as a random process and to model the solution as the expection value is so deep and insightful.
