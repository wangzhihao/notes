Think about on a page with several links. For different regions we want to show parts of links.
```
NA:                EU:               FE:
--------------     --------------    ------------- 
|   Link 1   |     |   Link 1   |    |  Link 1   |
|   Link 2   |     |   Link 3   |    |  Link 4   |
|   Link 3   |     --------------    -------------
|   Link 4   |     
-------------- 
```

How do we write a clean and flexible code for this?
