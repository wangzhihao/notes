## Description
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component

Hopcroft and Tarjan present [a DFS based algorithm](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/algoritmedesign_f03/Artikler/06/Hopcroft73.pdf) to find biconnected component. However the paper didn't prove it. Here is [a proof by Reingold](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f12/lectures/biconnected.pdf). 

## Implementation
Here is an implementation of [biconnected components](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_solution&cr=22858920&rd=17422&pm=15257). Here is [an implementation by myself](https://github.com/wangzhihao/notes/blob/stream-survey/computer_science/algorithms/topcoder/MaxCutFree/MaxCutFree_SCC_Version.java)
