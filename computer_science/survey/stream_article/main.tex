\section{Problem}
The following questions serve as criteria to verify the proposal architecture.  \cite{latexcompanion}

\subsection{Do independent fields delay each other?}
Inventory Health team has a fat table which contains about 30 fields of data. Some fields are pair-wise independent like Inventory Age and Glance view. But one field delays will also block the other one.

\subsection{Is it human fault tolerant?}
Suppose the whole system crash down, How to recover to a consistent state? How to be human fault tolerant?
\begin{quote}
Yet there's a form of fault-tolerance that's much more important than machine fault-tolerance: human fault-tolerance. If there's any certainty in software development, it's that developers aren't perfect and bugs will inevitably reach production. Our data systems must be resilient to buggy programs that write bad data. \cite{latexcompanion}
