\begin{problem}
    Prove Cauchy's inequality.

    \begin{equation}
        \sum_i^n{a_ib_i} \leq \sqrt{\sum_i^n{a_i^2}}  \sqrt{\sum_i^n{b_i^2}}
    \end{equation}

    Moreover, if you already know a proof of Cauchy's inequality, find another one!

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    We can prove it in algebra way.

    Firstly, if the square of the inequality holds, the inequality will also hold. Since the right side is non-negative. From this view, we can transform
    the problem to prove the square of the inequality as follows.

    \begin{equation*}
        (\sum_i^n{a_ib_i})^2 \leq \sum_i^n{a_i^2}  \sum_i^n{b_i^2}
    \end{equation*}

    Let's define $\Delta$ as the subtraction of the left side from the right side,

    \begin{equation*}
        \Delta = \sum_i^n{a_i^2}  \sum_i^n{b_i^2} - (\sum_i^n{a_ib_i})^2
    \end{equation*}

    which can be reduced to

    \begin{align*}
        \Delta & = \sum_{i,j}{a_i^{2}b_j^{2}} - \sum_{i,j}{a_ib_ia_jb_j} \\
               & = \sum_{i,j}{a_ib_j(a_ib_j - a_jb_i)}
    \end{align*}

    Now if we add $\Delta$ with itself, since the indices $i,j$ are interchangable, we will end up with the following:

    \begin{align*}
        \Delta + \Delta & = \sum_{i,j}{a_ib_j(a_ib_j - a_jb_i)} + \sum_{i,j}{a_jb_i(a_jb_i - a_ib_j)} \\
               & = \sum_{i,j}{a_ib_j(a_ib_j - a_jb_i) - a_jb_i(a_ib_j - a_jb_i)} \\
               & = \sum_{i,j}{(a_ib_j - a_jb_i)^2} \\
               & \geq 0
    \end{align*}

    We can also prove from the intuitive geometry or vector way, which is omitted here.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
    For Book Exercise 1.1. Prove for each real sequence $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ one has:

    \begin{equation*}
        a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n \leq \sqrt{n}(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \end{equation*}

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We can view the sum of the sequence as the inner product of vectors in $\mathbb{R}_n$: $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ and $(1, 1, ..., 1)$. Then it becomes obvious from Cauchy's inequality.
\end{proof}
\begin{exercise}
    For Book Exercise 1.1. Prove 

    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{k=1}^{n}{a_k} \leq (\sum_{k=1}^{n}{|a_k|^{2/3}})^{\frac{1}{2}} (\sum_{k=1}^{n}{|a_k|^{4/3}})^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \end{equation*}

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We can view the sum as the inner product of vectors in $\mathbb{R}_n$: $(a_1^{\frac{1}{3}}, a_2^{\frac{1}{3}}, ..., a_n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ and $(a_1^{\frac{2}{3}}, a_2^{\frac{2}{3}}, ..., a_n^{\frac{2}{3}})$. Then it becomes obvious from Cauchy's inequality.
\end{proof}
